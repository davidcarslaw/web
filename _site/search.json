The examples given here are based on using R and RStudio.\n\nSome of the advantages of this approach include:\n\nR is fantastically capable software and goes far beyond ‘just’ statistics;\nvery good for data exploration and data visualisation;\ngreat for making your work reproducible and sharing it (we’ll come back to that);\nthese skills are highly valuable in academia, industry and almost any discipline that involves data.\nProbably more accurate to say R and python. Both of these languages are highly capable and it’s highly recommended to learn one, or both!"

However, a good place to start is understanding two broad issues:\n\nWhat type of variation occurs within variables?\nWhat type of covariation occurs between variables?\n\n\nTo answer these questions there are a large number of approaches that can be used that cover:\n\nNumerical-type statistics (understanding numbers of measurements, their ranges, means etc.)\nThere are also a wide number of very useful ways to plot data to explore these characteristics\nNo silver bullet and having different ‘views’ / perspectives on data is very useful"
